## Whether we're monitoring an Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain.
## Enabling this will get disk statistics from Cloudwatch instead of
## Elasticsearch directly, due to Amazon reserving part of the volume for
## internal operations.

  ## Interval for how often Prometheus scrapes the prometheus-cloudwatch-exporter

  ## exporter makes API calls to Amazon Cloudwatch every time Prometheus scrapes
